# Project_3_Food_Delivery

## Project 3:
Food related; different food that Canadians eat
## GOAL?
To build something (a webpage? an app?) that allows the user to search what they want to eat based on preference and price, etc (other filters) .
## WHY?
Food prices are so expensive, and there are so many choices out there.
If you live alone or even if you have a family, anyone would benefit from spending less time to decide what you want to eat and to get the most out of your money.
## IDEAS:
Doordash orders dataset (could probably extend the webscraping method to ubereats to use their dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/satoshiss/food-delivery-in-canada-door-dash/code)
- Leaflet chloropleth map
- Most-ordered food per neighbourhood in the GTA
- Highest ratings/lowest rating
- Restaurant with good reviews/bad reviews
- Multiple ways to filter data? I.e. two or more selection boxes?
- Chloropleth map? Cluster markers?
